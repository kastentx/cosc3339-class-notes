# Virtual Memory

* memory that is higher in the hierarchy gets to reach down to a lower level
* **Address Space** memory that can be addressed by a program
  * each program gets compiled in its own address space
* **Pages** a the basic unit for allocation of memory, and transfers from disk to memory
  * these have a fixed size for any given system, which is determined by HW and OS
  * typical size is 4 KB - 16 KB (superpages 2MB - 4MB)
* with virtual memory, each program has their own **virtual address space**
  * load and store instructions in a program specify an address in the virtual address space
  * during runtime, each _virtual address_ gets converted into a _physical address_
    * this happens by a combination of hardware and software
    * make sure we know how to do this calculation - page offset is similar to byte offset w/ caches
* the **page table** contains the _virtual page number_ to _physical page number_ conversions
* it takes an extra memory access to translate a virtual address into a physical one
* **TLB: Fast Address Translation** - (translation look-aside buffer)
  * uses a smaller amount of entries for faster searching/translation
  * a TLB Miss occurs when the VPN to PPN mapping is not found in the TLB
* **Page Fault** occurs when the page is not in the main memory
  * requires disk access (1,000,000s of cycles)
