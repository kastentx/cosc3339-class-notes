## Clock Cycles
* one way to reduce clock cycles is specific types of efficient coding
    - for example, instead of doing one comparison instead of two
* Calculating **efective CPI** is done by multiplying the frequency (of that class of instruction) and the CPI
    - this represents a more accurate CPI value for the whole system, since it will likely perform a variety of tasks
    - Instruction Classes include:
        + ALU
        + Load
        + Store
        + Branch
    - Speedup can be expressed by a ratio of Effective CPI values

### Improving Effective CPI
* reducing the effective cpi for an instruction class will improve the speed of the entire system
    - the effect is proportional to the frequency of that Instruction Class
* branch prediction can be used to shave off clock cycles, improving effective CPI
* When two Instructions can be executed at once, or more (multi-core) the Effective CPI for that class of instruction is divided by the number of simultaneous instructions
    - for example. if the ALU class takes 1 cycle, and then you go to a system doing 8 instructions at once, the effective CPI is reduced to 0.125

### CPU Time
```
CPU_TIME = instruction_count * CPI * clock_cycle

CPU_TIME = (instruction_count * CPI) / clock_rate
```

* These equations separate the three key factors that affect performance
    - The clock rate is usually given
    - Can measure overall instruction count by using profilers/ simulators without knowing all of the implementation details
    - CPI varies by instruction type and ISA implementation for which we must know the implementation details

### Other CPU Performance Factors
* **Instruction Count** is influenced by:
    - Algorithms
    - Programming Language
    - Compiler
    - Instruction Set Architecure
* **CPI** is influenced by:
    - Algorithms
    - Programming Language
    - Compiler
    - Instruction Set Architecture
    - Core Organization
* **Clock Cycle Count** is influenced by:
    - Instruction Set Architecture
    - Core Organization
    - Technology

## Axiom IV: Context is Important
* Different metrics and different applications need to be used to accurately evaluate different types of devices.
    - embedded processors
    - mobile devices
    - desktops
    - servers
    - clusters/supercomputers
* **Power/Energy consumption** used to be a concern only for embedded systems, but now all types of computers must take this into account
    - to test/measure this, additional HW is often required
* **Throughput** is a concern for data centers, servers, etc
    - measures # of tasks per unit time
    - total amount of work done in a given time
    - decreasing execution time almost always improves throughput
    - sometimes called _bandwidth_
* **FLOPS** are _floating-point operations per second_
    - these are a measure of throughput
    - used when evaluating supercomputers (like on Top500.org)
    - commonly seen as GigaFlops, TeraFlops, PetaFlops..
* **Benchmarks** are specifically selected programs used to compare performance
    - these programs are inteded to more accurately represent performance in real applications
* **Workloads** are a set of programs that represent a _collection_ of applicaitons that can be run on a system in a given period
* There are some PAID benchmark tests that we have access to, thanks to the license from the research lab
    - for example there is one called **SPEC** that we use
        + SPEC CPU2006 uses 12 integer benchmarks and 17 floating-point benchmarks

###### project idea
* how fast does your program (or benchmarks) run on some differentt types of machines?
