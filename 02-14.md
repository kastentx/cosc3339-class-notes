## Upcoming
* First Test - 02/28 (tuesday)
  - mostly math-based problems
  - some MIPS pseudocode

* Project Proposals due 02/21 (tuesday)
  - 1 to 2 paragraph write-up on what we want to show with Project
  - only one turned in per group
  - group \#14

## Review
* Issues in ISA Design
* Types of ISAs and Architectures
  - Architecture vs ISA vs Implementation
* CISC vs RISC
* 32-bit vs 64-bit

## Today
* Fixed-point operations

### Arithmetic
* ALU speeds up calculations
* different ways of handling negative numbers out there
  - **two's complement** is the easiest to do operations on
    - adding a positive and negative number actually gives zero, unlike other methods
* unsigned addition is faster, because you don't need to worry about signs at all

#### Two's complement
* if you have 32 bits...
  - MSB reserved for sign, so only 31 bits available for value
  - biggest positive number = (2^31) - 1
  - smallest negative number = -(2^31)

### Implementation of Binary addition
* adds should be very fast... around 1-2 cycles (preferably one)
* you need a variety of gates for a ripple-carry adder (naive adder)
  - XOR to do the sum
  - AND for the carryout
  - NAND for the carryin
* _carry lookahead adders_ are used as a minor form of parallelism
  - offers a faster way of doing binary addition

### Overflow
* can happen anytime you're performing an operation with a carry bit
* needs two positive or two negative numbers.. can't happen when adding pos/neg
* MIPS offers an overflow flag

### Multiplication
* multiplication is done through repetitive adding
  * shifts and adds are used... needs logic to determine when
* Version 1 includes a:
  * Multiplier (32-bit)
  * Multiplicand (64-bit)
  * Product (64-bit)
