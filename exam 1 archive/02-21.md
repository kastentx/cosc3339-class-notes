## IEEE Floating point FOrmat

* Storage
  * **sign**
    * 1 bit
  * **Exponent**
    * single: 8 bits
    * double: 11 bits
  * **Fraction**
    * single: 23 bits
    * double: 52 bits

#### Single-Precision
* (example on p.222)
* special representations for:
  * **NaN values**
    * sign doesn't matter
    * exponent all 1s
    * fraction is non-zero
  * **infinity**
    * sign-dependant
    * exponent all 1s
    * fraction is all zero
  * **zero**
    * everything is zero
* special cases come out of standard range
  * instead of (-127) to (128) we have (-126) to (127) as range of exponents
  * all 1s and all 0s in exponent are reserved
