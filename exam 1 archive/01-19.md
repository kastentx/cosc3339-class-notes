# Lecture 1: Evaluating Performance

```
Need to start brain-storming project ideas
    - proposals will be due soon... next week?
    - more info to be posted on TRACS
    - Raspberry Pi, HDL mentioned
```

* The heap / power wall
    - problem due to increased power density
    - led to multi-core architectures becoming the new frontier
* intel uses **tick-tock** model [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-Tock_model)
* instead of only worrying about speed, we are now more concerned with _efficiency_
* **benchmarks** are a series of tests that look at a variety of metrics
    - can be used to compare machines relative to each other
* when evaluating performance, several metrics are used:
    - Execution Time
    - Speedup
    - CPU Time
    - Clock Rate
    - Cycle Count
    - CPI (cycles per instruction)
    - Instruction Count (how many instructions can be executed in a given time)
* **electromigration** iron displacement on the wire causes systems to slow over time[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration)
    - speed is directly proportional to capacitance
* **execution time** is the time between the start and the completion of a task
    - typically a 'task' is a program
    - can be 'boot' time or 'load' time 
    - also called _response time_ or _wall clock time_
* **boot times** have been improved greatly by better/faster storage, like solid state drives
* To perform a search, you will need:
    - the data you want to find/search for
    - a data structure, like an array or list
* to _maximize_ performance, we must _minimize_ execution time
    - we use the formula: performance = 1/execution\_time
* citing **absolute performance** doesn't tell us much
* there needs to be a baseline to measure _relative_ performance
    - we use a ratio called **speedup**
        + performance(x)/performance(y) = execution\_time(x)/execution\_time(y) = n
    - speedup > 1 is good
    - speedup < 1 is bad

#### Clock Cycles
* every computer has a clock that ticks
    - each tick of the clock is known as a **clock cycle**
    - the smaller the clock cycle, the faster the machine
    - speed of clock can be found in the processor specification
* ticks per second is measured in GHz (used to be MHz)
    - this is the advertised processor speed
    - computed as the inverse of clock cycle
    - ex: _going from 1 MHz to 1 GHz is 1000 times speedup_
* **clock skew** is the error due to propogation time, wires, etc.
    - very hard to start two clocks at the _exact_ same time.
* **CPU execution time** = # of cycles x clock cycle time
    - OR execution time = # of cycles needed / clock rate

##### CPI (Cycles per Instruction)
* not all instructions take the same amount of time to execute
* CPI is the avg number of clock cycles each instruction takes to execute
