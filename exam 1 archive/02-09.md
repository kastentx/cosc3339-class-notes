### Synchronization in Parallel Programs
* Almost all parallel programs need some level of Synchronization
  - in software, you accomplish this with _mutex locks_
* to implement mutual exclusion or critical selection, you must be able to perform **atomic operations**
  - execute x and y
  - guarantee nothing happens between them
* A common type of atomic operation in **swap**

### Support for Vector Instructions
* usually in the form of a co-processor embedded on the chip
* will perform the same operation on multiple pieces of data in parallel (usually pipelined)
* Compiler is responsible for issuing these instructions

## Principles of ISA Design
* Keep it Simple
* Make the **common case fast**
  - AKA focus on optimizing the instructions that happen the most!

## MIPS Overview & Comparison with x86
* online simulators available (mars, SPIM)

#### MIPS Processor
* most of the area is taken up by memory
* Floating Point Datapath is also very large

* to preserve values across a function call, they must be stored in the stack and then restored after execution
  - MIPS does not support push or pop

* **stack pointer** points to the top of the stack
* **frame pointer** points to the bottom of the stack

* **jump and link** grabs Program Counter (PC) and stores the value in return address (RA)

* for every function, there is a separate frame pointer, stack pointer, and return address

#### Instruction Length and Encoding
* simple fixed instruction length (4 bytes)
* includes 90 different instructions
* 3 types of encoding (R, I, and J)
* ISA has **pseudo instructions** that are sequences of normal instructions
* word is 32 bit length
