# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

### 3 Types of Instructions
1. ALU
    - type of operation (op code)
    - where to get source operands (usually registers)
    - where to put result (usually registers)
    - number of operands (implicit)
    - order of operands (implicit)
2. BRANCH
    - type of operation
        + conditional
            * needs target mem address
        + unconditional
            * value for test condition
3. LOAD/STORE
    - memory address
    - source and destination (for move)

### Encoding
* Instruction length
    - fixed (easier to decode)
        + can be used with a constant program counter
    - variable (harder to decode)
* Number of Operands
* Immediate Instructions

## Registers
* **Registers** are the tiny memory located inside the CPU
    - usually big enough to hold one `word`
    - set of registers is called a **register file**
    - faster than main memory (roughly 1000x)
* Some registers are designated for _special values_
    - **PC**: Program Counter/Instruction Pointer
    - **SP**: Stack Pointer (top of the stack)
    - **FP**: Frame Pointer (usually bottom of stack)
    - **ZERO** (on MIPS)
* Size is very limited 
    - memory is frequent CPU performance bottleneck
* most architectures have between 8 and 64 registers
    - more is better, but there are challenges
        + more bits needed to store bigger addresses
        + tau = rc (propogation delay)
* **Register Spill** occurs when a program needs more variables than there are registers
    - hardware will push the data to the next best mem type (L1 Cache)
    - can have a large impact on performance
    - compilers work hard to minimize register spills

#### Addressing Distant Locations
* _highest memory address_ = Instruction\_Size - opcode\_size - operand\_size
    - for example 32 - 5 - 6 = 21
    - 2^21 = 2 MB
    - so 2 MB would be the highest usable address (therefore largest program size)
* a solution that works well for this is **indirect or relative addressing**
    - access instructions and data using an offset from a common base address
    - store the base address in some register
        + PC, SP, FP, etc.
* **jumps** come from loops and if-else statements
    - jump to next instruction if test is true
    - if test is false, PC jumps past the _if_ clause
* most common form of indirect addressing is called **PC-relative addressing**
    - can use the address of current instruction as base address
    - when current instruction is in PC, you have a range of 2^15
* use SP register as base address when addressing program data
    - SP + offset = address
* there are several different types of addressing modes:
    - we use byte-addressing, but don't deal in bits
    - some architectures allow for addresses bigger than a byte
        + like a word(4 bytes), double word(8 bytes) etc
* main advantage of having larger addressable units:
    - fewer bits used in specifying address

#### Amount of Data Transfer
* the amount of data loaded or stored in each instruction may vary in some ISAs
    - some ISAs support different load/store instructions to handle _how much_ data will be accessed
        + `ld`
        + `lw`
        + `ldd`
    - in reality, we almost never bring in just one byte or one word from memory    
* There are advantages to bringing in more data than necessary
    - caches, locality of reference, etc.

#### Alignment
* some architectures restrict _different-sized_ data transfers to certain addresses
    - this is called **alignment restrictions**

### Memory 
* a **word** is considered a _natural unit_ of access in a computer
    - the most frequently accessed size of data
    - over the years, a 'word' has grown from 8-bit to 64-bit
    - sometimes ISA implementations may be referenced using their word size
* **big-endian** stores the most significant byte at the lowest address
* **little-endian** stores the most significant byte at the highest address

### 64-bit advantages over 32-bit
* larger memory addresses possible
    - can go up to 2^64
* Register Size
    - size of registers may or may not change
* Instruction Length
* O/S and Compiler
    - code generation
        + exploit 64-bit features
        + load byte vs word
    - Memory allocation
    - Virtual to physical memory mapping


## PROJECT IDEA: 
* measure number of register spills and teh associated costs in two different ISAs or for two different compilers

##### Random notes: 
* "read before write" hazard (collision-detection)
    - if memory addresses match, wait for write to finish before reading
