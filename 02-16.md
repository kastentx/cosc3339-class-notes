## Updates
* Project Ideas due on Tuesday (not formal proprosal)
* HW 3 is due next thursday (1 week from today)
  * solutions will be posted online Friday
* Test 1 is the following Tuesday

## Review
* **naive multiplier** uses 8 cycles per operation, with 32 operations (32-bit multiplier)
  * total of 256 gates
  * uses shifts and r

# New Stuff

### Multipliers
* **Multiplier v2**
  * 32-bit multiplicand _(instead of 64-bit in v1)_
  * 32-bit ALU _(instead of 64-bit in v1)_
  * Product stays 64-bit
* **Multiplier v3**
  * uses a 64-bit combined multiplier & product
  * shifts right
* Problems with Timing
  * Clock Slew
  * Clock Jitter

### Decimal Division
* takes at least twice as long as multiplication
* has to check if the partial dividend is greater than the quotient each time
* after subtracting, needs to check for negative number
  * if difference is positive, write to the quotient
* in some cases a reset is needed (not sure when... need to study this)

## Floating-point
* used for 'real' numbers
  * allows representations of really large, really small, and very specific numbers

### Scientific Notation
* 3 parts
  * the Sign
  * the Mantissa (fractional part)
  * the Exponent
* the mantissa is usually normalized (to 1.xxx form)
* in binary, this becomes `(-1) x F x 2^E`
  * 1 bit for sign, then the remaining bits split between fraction & exponent
    * 0 means non-negative, 1 means negative (for all formats)
* architects have settled on **two** standards (for portability issues)
  * **single-precision** (32-bit)
    * mantissa: 23
    * exponent: 8
    * sign: 1
  * **double-precision** (64-bit)
    * mantissa: 52
    * exponent: 11
    * sign: 1

## TO STUDY:
* multiplication
* division
* floating-point numbers
